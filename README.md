We are here to create a modern Blog SPA with AngularJS 1.4.x. Let's have a quick look first:

![Portfolio SPA](http://angularjs-recipes.com/img/series/1f6j1a.jpg)

Follow steps below to bootstrap the application:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:angularjs-recipes/blog.git
cd blog
npm install -g bower grunt-cli live-server
npm install grunt --save-dev
bower install && grunt install
live-server
```

The application is already launched pointing to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/#/`
